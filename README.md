# GimpGuidesMatrix
Gimp plugin for creating an even matrix of guides.
It's specially usefull for working with tile sheets.

To install just copy the guides-matrix.scm file to your gimp plugins folder (on my machine that is ~/.gimp-2.8/scripts/)
Restart Gimp so that it loads the extension and you'll find it under Images->Guides->New Guide Matrix
